## Welcome to Doniyor Xujamov on the web!
<br>
It's been a while now that I've wanted to have a personal website - just somewhere to be able to park random files/documents and perhaps even host a blog where I can brain dump my personal and professional thoughts. 
<!--more-->

I remember several years ago, when I was in my 3rd/4th year of my undergrad, all the teachers started having their own sites and even on these sites I worked for money. And by cool teachers I of course mean the nerdiest of us. It’s a funny that a lot of web developers don’t have an up to date website. My guess is like myself, it’s hard to find time/enthusiasm to create your own site when you could be getting paid to make on to someone else. In Waterloo Computer Science, geek is the new cool. I always felt out of place for not having one myself, so now I finally get to feel like a programmer who spend time on himself, only several years too late!

Just as a reference, I do have [an existing web blog on Wordpress which created by our old team](https://shift.uz) that was mostly populated throughtout some of my earlier posts. 

Lastly, **[subscribe to my feed](https://xujamov.github.io/feed.xml)!**  To be completely honest, I actually never ever used RSS in my life and wasn't exactly sure how they work (somehow I missed out on the huge RSS era a few years ago when everybody was getting on it), but I learned today that it's pretty simple and awesome.  You install any RSS reader in about 4 seconds, add my RSS feed to it, and now every time I publish a new post you'll immediately know! 

This website is currently in its infancy, so do let me know if you find any bugs/typos/have any comments at all. All comments are welcome. Unless they're not nice, in which case a PayPal donation is required for me to read your comment ;)
